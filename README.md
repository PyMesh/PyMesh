### About PyMesh ###

**PyMesh** is a code base developed by Qingnan Zhou for his PhD research at New
York University.  It is a rapid prototyping platform focused on geometry
processing.  **PyMesh** is written with both C++ and Python, where
computational intensive functionalities are realized in C++, and Python is used
for creating minimalistic and easy to use interfaces.

### Documentation ###

[Latest documentation](http://pymesh.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

### Quick try ###

Perhaps the easiest way of trying out PyMesh is through
[docker](https://www.docker.com/):

    docker run -it pymesh/pymesh
    Python 3.6.4 (default, Feb 17 2018, 09:32:33)
    [GCC 4.9.2] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import pymesh

For example, to run [meshstat.py](scripts/meshstat.py):

    docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/models pymesh/pymesh meshstat.py -x /models/model.obj

This command mounts your current working directory to the `/models` directory
in a docker container and executes the `meshstat.py` script on the mesh file
`model.obj` in the current directory.

### Download Source ###

To retrieve the code:

    git clone https://github.com/PyMesh/PyMesh.git
    cd PyMesh
    git submodule update --init

  quality mesh generator and Delaunay triangulator.

All of the optional libraries are included in `$PYMESH_PATH/third_party`
directory.

### Specify Dependency Locations ###

All dependencies are included as git submodules in the `third_party` directory.
It is recommended to build these dependencies directly (see [Build](#Build) section).
However, it is possible to use an existing dependency installed on your system.
If the dependent library is not installed in standard locations
(``/usr/local/``, ``/opt/local``), one needs to set environment variables that
point to the correct directories.  PyMesh check the following environment
variables:

* Eigen: Set ``EIGEN_PATH`` to the directory containing the `eigen3` directory.
* CGAL: Set ``CGAL_PATH`` to the directory containing `UseCGAL.cmake` file.
    * Boost: Set ``BOOST_INC`` to the directory containing boost.
    * GMP: Set ``GMP_INC`` and ``GMP_LIB`` to the directories containing GMP
      header and library.
* libigl: Set ``LIBIGL_PATH`` the ``include`` directory of libigl sources.
* Cork: Set ``CORK_PATH`` to the install directory of Cork.
* Tetgen: Set ``TETGEN_PATH`` to the install directory of Tetgen.
* Triangle: Set ``TRIANGLE_PATH`` to the install directory of Triangle.
* Qhull: Set ``QHULL_PATH`` to the install directory of Qhull.
* Clipper: Set ``CLIPPER_PATH`` to the install directory of Clipper.
* Carve: Set ``CARVE_PATH`` to the install directory of Carve.
* Geogram: Set ``GEOGRAM_PATH`` to the install directory of Geogram.
* Quartet: Set ``QUARTET_PATH`` to the install directory of Quartet.
* Draco: Set ``Draco_PATH`` to the install directory of Draco.
* MMG: Set ``MMG_PATH`` to the install directory of MMG.

### Build ###

Let `$PYMESH_PATH` be the root directory of the repository.
The first step is to compile the optional third party dependencies:

    cd $PYMESH_PATH/third_party
    build.py all

Third party dependencies will be installed in
`$PYMESH_PATH/python/pymesh/third_party` directory.

To successfully complete the build above on Ubuntu 20.04, you will need to install these dependencies first:

    sudo apt install build-essential cmake
    sudo apt install libgmp-dev
    sudo apt install libmpfr-dev
    sudo apt install libboost-dev

Now we can build the main project.  It is recommended to build out of source:

    cd $PYMESH_PATH
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

To build the PyMesh library:

    make
    make tests

Make sure all unit tests are passed before using the library.

### Install ###

The output of building PyMesh consists a set of C++ libraries and a python
module. Installing the C++ library is currently not available.  However,
installing the python package can be done:

    ./setup.py build # This an alternative way of calling cmake/make
    ./setup.py install

To check PyMesh is installed correctly, run the following python unit tests::

    python -c "import pymesh; pymesh.test()"

Once again, make sure all unit tests are passed, and report any unit test
failures.
